  <p><i>
    This is the third project we have completed for Engineering and Design 1.
    The goal of this project was to create a 3D model and 3D print of a toy
    car to scale.
  </i></p>

  <h3>Guidelines: </h3>
  <p>
    These are the guidelines for this project.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms </li>
    <li>Design car in a 1:1 ratio </li>
    <li>Size accuracy +/- 1% </li>
    <li>Design is exported as STL </li>
    <li>Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
    <li>File is exported as a GCODE </li>
    <li>Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Steps: </h3>
  <p>
    These are the steps for creating the 3D car model.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Draw
    <ul class = "square">
      <li>Draw the matchbox car to scale as an Engineering Drawing </li>
      <li>Scan or photograph drawing </li>
      <li>Capture screenshots of each plane side </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>3D Modeling
    <ul class = "square">
      <li>Draw each profile on each side plane</li>
      <li>Using the extrusion tool, remove the negative spaces from the 3D form</li>
      <li>Use extrusion and fillet tools for finish details </li>
      <li>Export STL file </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Slicing and Printing
    <ul class = "square">
      <li>Import design into Cura
        <ul class = "square">
            <li>Make any final scaling changes </li>
            <li>Position 3D model on build plate to minimize support material </li>
            <li>Setting to 0.6mm nozzle </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Export as a GCODE file</li>
      <li>Print model</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Documentation
    <ul class = "square">
        <li>CAD drawing with margin of error analysis </li>
        <li>Import design into Modelo to make a 3D model </li>
        <li>Reflection will be a HTML document with blurb and 3D render </li>
        <li>Add photo of car next to model into Slide Deck </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Setbacks and Solutions: </h3>
  <p><i>
    These are the setbacks I encountered while trying to create my car
    and the solutions I came up with to overcome them.
  </i></p>
  <p>
    One of the setbacks I encountered was that when I tried to extrude the right
    wheels of the car forward and backward so that the wheels on both sides would stick out,
    I could not make them extrude on the both sides using the same wheel drawing
    because it made the wheel continous across the entire bottom of the car. In order
    to fix this, I created two drawings on either side of the car and then extruded them
    both out away from the car.
  </p>

  <h3>Process and Photos: </h3>
  <p><i>
    This is the description of the process I took for creating my car and
    images of the steps that I took.
  </i></p>
  <p>
    I first created a Engineering Drawing of my car using exact measurements that I
    calculated using calipers. The drawing contained three images of the car, one
    from the front, one from the side, and one from the top. In OnShape, I created
    a rectangle that had the same length, width, and height as the car. I took each
    view from my Engineering Drawing and pasted it onto its coordinating side of the
    car. I then removed the negative space to finalize the basic model of my
    car. I wanted to add a lot of details, so I created doors, side-view mirrors,
    a truck bed, front bumper details, wheel designs, and seats. I made the interior
    of the car hollow so that you could see through the windows and the
    front windshield into the seats. I then created an STL file and a GCODE
    file that I uploaded to the 3D Printer to fabricate my design. When calculating
    my margin of error, I found that the size ratio of my car to the original
    car is 1:1.
